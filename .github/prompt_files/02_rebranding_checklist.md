Perform a global search and replace operation across the entire repository.

**Primary Objective:** Complete rebranding to "ScholaPro".

**Checklist:**
1.  **Textual Occurrences:**
    * Find "Rosariosis" (case-insensitive) and replace with "ScholaPro".
    * Find "rosariosis" (case-insensitive) and replace with "scholapro".
    * Pay close attention to variable names, function names, comments, and user-facing text.
2.  **Configuration Files:**
    * Inspect `config.inc.php-sample` and any other configuration files for project names or titles.
3.  **Image & Asset Files:**
    * List all files in `assets/`, `images/`, or similar directories that contain the Rosariosis logo or branding. We will replace these manually.
4.  **CSS/Theming:**
    * Identify the primary CSS/LESS/SASS files that define the color scheme. Propose a new color palette for ScholaPro (e.g., primary: #4A90E2, secondary: #50E3C2). Generate the CSS code to implement this new theme.

Execute step 1 and 2, and provide me with the list and CSS code for steps 3 and 4.
